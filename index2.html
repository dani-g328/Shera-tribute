          <p>Adora is Catra's best friend, and it has been shown that the two once shared an extremely close bond, growing up together as orphans in the Horde. After Adora left the horde for the rebellion, they became enemies and tried to stop each other at all costs. Both Adora and Catra developed romantic feelings for each other but never acted upon them.

        <p>Lance and George, Bow's dads, are pretty minor characters. They are both historians and take great pride in their artifacts. They have several children together, Bow, Woe, Sow, Oboe, Gogh, Waoh, and represent a stable, gay relationship that is often missing in media. They do not approve of the rebellion or their son participating as the first time the princess alliance was put together they got burned a bit.</p>
